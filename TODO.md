# TODO

1. Tests (API and BoardService)
2. Card Archetypes, Board Archetypes, outside of BoardService faking it
3. There's no comment/update yet. Need the bare minimum (and only that)
4. General UI/UX improvements. Labels are needed (with colors, ideally)
5. File / image attachments, but these require special consideration because runa can not currently see them
   without external OCR and other help, and there's no Runa API endpoint to receive them. In the database is
   one option.
6. Labels, for the sake of the cosmos, labels!!!
